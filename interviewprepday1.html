    <h4>Q1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h4>
    <pre>
       == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable. === is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.
    </pre>

    <h4>Q2.What is the spread operator?</h4>
    <pre>
        Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array.
    </pre>

    <h4>Q3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h4>
    <pre>
        Variables declared with var are in the function scope.
        Variables declared as let are in the block scope.
        Variables declared as const are in the block scope.

    <h4>Q4.What is execution context?</h4>
    <pre>
        The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution. During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
      </pre>
      <h4>
       Q5.What is meant by first class functions
      </h4>
      <pre>
        A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
      </pre>

     <h4>Q6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</h4>
     <pre>
        A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to the outer function variable. In JavaScript, every time a closure is created with the creation of a function.

        The closure has three scope chains listed as follows:

        Access to its own scope.
        Access to the variables of the outer function.
        Access to the global variables.
     </pre>

     <h4>Q7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h4>
    <pre>
        The call() method invokes a function with a specified context. In other words, you can tie a function into an object as if it belonged to the object.

        Example:var obj = { num: 2 };
        function add(a){
          return this.num + a;
        }
        The apply() method does the exact same as call(). The difference is that call() accepts an argument list, but apply() accepts an array of arguments.

        Example:
        var obj = { num: 2 };
        
        function add(a, b){
          return this.num + a + b;
        }
        
        console.log(add.apply(obj, [3, 5]));
        The bind() method is reminiscent of call() and apply(). But instead of executing a function immediately, bind() returns a function that can be executed later on.
        
        Examole:var obj = { num: 2 };

        function add(a, b){
          return this.num + a + b;
        }
        
        const func = add.bind(obj, 3, 5);
        func(); // Returns 10
